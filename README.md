- 👋 Hi, I’m @hajunho
- 💞️ I love codes.
- 📫 How to reach me mynameis@hajunho.com

I have a family that I love dearly. Despite this, a significant part of my life is spent with code. I started programming at the age of 7, and now, at 43, I still feel passionate about it. This is why I love code. I plan to continue programming until I am 88. I want to love deeply and live life to the fullest, leaving this world without any regrets
