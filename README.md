- 👋 Hi, I’m @hajunho
- 💞️ I love codes.
- 📫 How to reach me mynameis@hajunho.com

I have a family, and I love them. However, I spend a tremendous amount of time with code. I started programming at 7, and now, at 43, I am still programming. That's why I love code. I want to be programming until I'm 88. I want to love with all my heart and leave without regrets.
